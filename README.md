# Module-6-Python-Code-

Hello my name is Victor, I am the author of these programs. There are six Python code programs within this repository. To use each of the programs paste the program's code into a text editor with Python support, run the program, and follow any on screen instructions and the results will be provided.

The first program incorporates importing the Math module. Using 'math,degrees' and another method of converting radians to degrees then print both conversions. Input from user to recieve radians value. 

The second program incorporates importing the Math module. Using 'math.factorial' and another method of calculating the factorial for a value given by the user. Print both calculations.

The third program incorporates importing the Math module. Using 'math.pi' and another method of calculating pi, print both approximations of pi. 

The fourth program incorporates importing the Random module. Using 'random.choice' to select a day of the week from a list and print that day. 

The fifth program incorporates importing the Random module. Using 'random.randrange' to print an odd integer between 0 and 100.

The sixth program incorporates importing the Random module. Using a 'for' statement and 'random.randrange' to print 10 random integers between 25 and 35.
